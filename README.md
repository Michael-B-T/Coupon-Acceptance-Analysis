# Coupon-Acceptance-Analysis
A data analysis project on customer coupon acceptance patterns.
This project explores which factors influence whether a customer accepts a coupon. It then compiles that data to be more comsumable for the human and machine learning.

# Key Findings (Bar Customers)
- Drivers who go to bars more than once a month are significantly more likely to accept bar coupons than those who donâ€™t.
- This acceptance rate further increases when:
-   They are over the age of 25
-   They are not accompanied by kids
-   They are not widowed
-   They do not work in farming, fishing, or forestry

# Actionable Recommendations (Bar Customers)
- Target bar coupons to:
-   Adults over 25 years old
-   Drivers who go to bars more than once a month
-   People with non-child passengers
-   Avoid targeting individuals with occupations in farming, fishing, or forestry

# Key Findings (Coffee House Customers)
- Drivers who visit coffee houses more than 3 times per month show a marked increase in coupon acceptance rates.
- Other correlated attributes include:
-   Being younger than 30
-   Having non-child passengers
-   Having an income under $50,000

# Actionable Recommendations (Coffee House Customers)
- Target coffee house coupons toward:
-   Frequent coffee drinkers (4+ visits/month)
-   Younger drivers (<30 years old)
-   Drivers with non-child passengers
-   Individuals earning below $50K/year

# Next Steps (Bar Customers)
- Consider adding location or time-of-day factors to refine bar coupon targeting.
- Use a predictive model to score potential bar coupon acceptance likelihood.
- Run A/B tests to evaluate bar coupon strategies

# Next Steps (Coffee House Customers)
- Explore correlations with other attributes like time of day or education level.
- Expand analysis to include coupon expiration, timing, and urgency.
- Test automated targeting with user profiles built on income, age, and coffee consumption.
