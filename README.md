# Coupon-Acceptance-Analysis
A data analysis project on customer coupon acceptance patterns.
This project explores which factors influence whether a customer accepts a coupon and compiles that data to be more comsumable for the human and machine learning.

# Key Findings
- Frequent bar-goers and drivers under age 30 are more likely to accept bar coupons.
- Having a passenger (but not a kid) and not being widowed also correlate with higher acceptance.
- Coupon acceptance tends to be higher in younger, social, and more active users.

# Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

# Deliverables
- Practical_Application_1.ipynb (Jupyter Notebook)
- coupons.csv (Dataset)
- Summary Visualizations and Analysis
